				Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
				world. The microvasculature, which is consists of the small,
				peripheral blood vessels, is responsible for orchestrating
				adjustments in vascular tone to match local tissue perfusion
				with oxygen demand. Microvascular dysfunction precedes and is
				predictive of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, thorough
				understanding of the microvasculature is important in preventing
				and treating cardiovascular disease.
