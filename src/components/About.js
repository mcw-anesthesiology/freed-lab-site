					Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the
					world. The microvasculature, which is consists of the small,
					peripheral blood vessels, is responsible for orchestrating
					adjustments in vascular tone to match local tissue perfusion
					with oxygen demand. Microvascular dysfunction precedes and is
					predictive of cardiovascular disease. Therefore, thorough
					understanding of the microvasculature is important in preventing
					and treating cardiovascular disease.
