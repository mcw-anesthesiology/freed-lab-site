Elderly individuals have a disproportionate risk of developing of cancer. Due
to the aging population, over the next ten years there will be a substantial
increase in the number of patients with cancer requiring surgical treatment.
This creates a challenge for our healthcare system, as elderly surgical
patients often have multiple co-morbidities, disabilities, and decreased
physiological reserve leading to increased hospital stays and postoperative
complications.  In addition to age and co-morbidities, neoadjuvant chemotherapy
is known to decrease physical fitness and increase one-year mortality following
surgery. The term frailty is used to describe decreased physiological reserve
that results in a diminished response to stress. Therefore, the ability to
‘prehabilitate’, or reduce frailty and increase functional capacity prior to
surgery, may improve patient outcomes and decrease disability in the elderly
population.  This clinical trial will be the first to examine the effects of
ischemic preconditioning (IPC) on preoperative and postoperative frailty in
elderly colon cancer patients.
