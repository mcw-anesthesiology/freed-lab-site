Sepsis is a leading cause of death in critically ill patients.
Bacterial-induced vasoplegia, or septic shock, is a state of low vascular
resistance leading to end-organ dysfunction and is associated with a high
mortality rate. The mechanism of bacterial-induced vasoplegia, or low blood
pressure, refractory to pharmacological vasoconstriction, remains unknown.
Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is a known vasodilator at lower concentrations and is
produced by most, if not all bacteria. Septic patients have elevated plasma
levels of H2S within 24 hours of diagnosis.

Hydroxocobalamin, or vitamin B12a, is a known H2S scavenger and has been used
clinically to treat intraoperative vasoplegia in liver as well as cardiac
disease patients. Our central hypothesis is that sources of H2S are capable of
causing vasoplegia in the microcirculation, which is both reversible and
preventable with use of cobalamins. This project examines the effect of H2S
from both exogenous sources, as well as from H2S-producing bacteria, on the
ability of a human microvessel to vasoconstrict. In addition to in vitro
studies, human plasma levels of H2S are measured using HPLC from both cardiac
surgery as well as septic patients.
