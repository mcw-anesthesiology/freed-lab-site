Currently, only invasive techniques, such as cardiac catheterization, are capable of diagnosing microvascular dysfunction in vivo. Since microvascular function precedes the formation of cardiovascular disease, early, non-invasive detection could allow for intervention prior to the development of atherosclerosis. Utilizing incident dark field imaging as well as optical coherence tomography (OCT), this project will allow for the development of a new, non-invasive technique in which to assess microvascular (dys)function in vivo and will allow for early detection of cardiovascular disease prior to life-threatening atherosclerotic complications including myocardial infarction or heart failure. This project is in collaboration with the departments of Ophthalmology, Biophysics, and Cell Biology, Neurobiology, and Anatomy.
