Because microvascular dysfunction precedes the formation of cardiovascular disease, early, non-invasive detection could allow for intervention prior to the development of atherosclerosis. Utilizing incident dark field imaging, this project will allow for the development of a new, non-invasive technique in which to assess microvascular (dys)function in vivo allowing for early detection of cardiovascular disease prior to life-threatening atherosclerotic complications including myocardial infarction or heart failure.
