title: CytoCam for In Vivo Microvascular Assessment

Currently, only invasive techniques, such as cardiac catheterization, are
capable of diagnosing microvascular dysfunction in vivo. Since microvascular
function precedes the formation of cardiovascular disease (i.e.
atherosclerosis) early, non-invasive detection could allow for intervention
prior to the development of atherosclerosis. This project will allow for the
development of a new, non-invasive technique in which to assess microvascular
(dys)function in vivo and will allow for early detection of cardiovascular
disease prior to life-threatening atherosclerotic complications including
myocardial infarction or heart failure.
